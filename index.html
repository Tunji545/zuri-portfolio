              Undertook several sensitization campaigns against irregular
              migration in my place of primary assignment. Planning and mapping
              out strategies on ways to convince the indigenes on the danger of
              illegal routes e.g. Sahara Desert, as a means of leaving ones
              native country. Engaging in Community Development service once in
              a month and also carrying out several projects. For example,
              mounting a gigantic billboard on the main road in Dutse, visible
              to commuters, warning them against engaging in irregular
              migration.

              We took the encapsulated product (blood tonic) from the
              Encapsulating room to the Blistering room. I then took the
              encapsulated product and blistered them. I check the deformed
              capsules from the Encapsulating room to separate them from being
              blistered. I also trimmed the leaflets of the blistered products
              to the right shape before moving them to another room where they
              will be neatly packed into cartons of various sizes.

              I performed both qualitative and quantitative test on the various
              raw materials used for production of blood tonic capsules as well
              as on the blistered capsules from the Blistering room to ascertain
              the accuracy of the various nutritional contents claimed before
              been sold out for consumption. We also perform various
              toxicological tests on the blistered products to make sure the
              products are safe for consumption.
